            <h2>About Colosseum</h2>
            <p>Sport was a pioneer of entertainment, sport played a vital part of human civilization & cultural development.</p>
            <p>We are inspired by one such incident took place in the history early 70AD where Rome built a huge viewing gallery called "Colosseum". Keeping this as an epic model people started building stadiums to host and play international sporting events like Olympics, Federation cups and serveral other Championship played around the globe.</p>
            <p>Now today's citizens are engaged completely into internet without any physical activity which leads to stress and other health hazard issues they face at the early stage.</p>
            <p>In order to make people excited to play sports and to refurbish their thought process to play sports and by playing sports they can stay active, healthier and become a successful individual in future.</p>
            <p>Now to bring these into reality "The Colosseum" is formed to create world class infrastructure and to provide access to public to make use of those facility.</p>
            <p>The Colosseum is a structured organization formed to create sports infrastructure and bridge the gap between sports facility and an individual, they need to enroll a membership in order to make use of the facility. Also they can bring their friends and family to get engaged through sports.</p>
            <p>We do provide these facility with following objectives :
            </p>
            <h6>Recreation model | Pro model | Social gathering model</h6>
